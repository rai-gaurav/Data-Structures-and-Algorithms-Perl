# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Perl
### Data structure and algorithms using Perl.
#### Tested on both Windows(Strawberry) and Linux platform.
<b> Perl version - 5.30</b> but hopefully will work on older version too (as old as 5.10) without any issue as Perl put a lot focus on backward compatibility.
